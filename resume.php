        <p>Dear Hiring Manager/Recruiter,</p>
              <p>Thank you for taking the time to review my resume. I bring over a decade of experience in web development, with a primary focus on WordPress. I have built and maintained dozens of websites, adapting both templates and custom designs to fit unique client needs. My technical skills, combined with my experience as a Product Owner, allow me to drive product development from ideation through execution, ensuring high-quality results that meet both user and business needs.</p>
              <p>As a Product Owner, I've embraced Agile methodologies to lead and launch new products, collaborating closely with cross-functional teams to optimize workflows and deliver projects on time. My communication skills enable me to bridge the gap between technical and non-technical stakeholders, facilitating alignment and efficiency across the board.</p>
              <p>In addition to my experience managing products, I have solid technical skills in HTML, CSS, and a working knowledge of JavaScript and PHP. I am also comfortable with GitHub, and I frequently use AI to develop custom WordPress plugins for prototyping and MVP creation. My personal product launch journey has provided me with a comprehensive understanding of the product lifecycle and the importance of a user-focused approach.</p>
              <p>Years of experience in customer service and sales have also instilled in me a client-focused perspective, ensuring that every solution I develop is both technically sound and user-friendly.</p>
              <p>Please don’t hesitate to reach out if my background aligns with any opportunities you have in mind. I’d be delighted to connect and discuss how my skills might benefit your project or team.</p>
              <p>Thank you for visiting my page—I look forward to connecting!</p>
              <p>Sincerely,<br />James Welbes</p>
