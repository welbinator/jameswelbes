        <p> My name is James Welbes, but you may know me as the "Google Hat Guy". I'm a person who does things. Lots of things.</p>
        <p>Mostly dumb things.</p>
        <p>But occasionally I do something right, like when I married my wife Kari, or when we adopted two amazing girls.</p>
        <p>I'm 6'4", my favorite food is Hamburger Helper. I was born in the 80s (and it shows). I'm a 7 on the enneagram which basically means I'm lazy and all I care about is having a good time. My wife is a 1 which means everybody sucks at everything and she's impossible to please. We make a great team. I do things, and she re-does them the "right" way.</p>
        <p>I grew up in Cedar Rapids, Iowa where I currently live. I've been all over the world, though my most memorable trip was when my wife and I spent 10 days in India. While there we mostly hung out at a children's home, but we were able to visit one of the many slums as well as a leper colony. And of course, we made the trip up to the Taj Mahal.</p>
        <p>Apart from building websites for literally anybody who's willing to pay me for it, I also own a coworking space in the NewBo area of Cedar Rapids, IA called <a href="https://escapethecube.space">The Space</a>. The best part of owning a coworking space is definitely the people. I've had an absolute blast building and being a part of the creative community in Cedar Rapids, and I am excited to see where this is going.</p>
        <p>At the beginning of 2019, I joined the organizing team for 1 Million Cups Cedar Rapids. My main duties included kicking the event off, introducing the speaker, and acting like I knew what was going on. I absolutely loved it.</p>
        <p>In what little free time I have, I like to play video games, soccer, and I'm especially fond of relaxing in my hammock with a good cigar and a good book. I also like to dabble in amateur woodworking.</p>
        <p>If you've made it this far, you have way too much time on your hands and you should really consider getting a hobby. I know for a fact I'm not that interesting, I almost fell asleep twice writing this.</p>
        <p>If for some reason you would like to get in touch with me, I'd love to connect! You can find me on the interwebs via those cute little icons in the menu, or you can fill out my <a href="contact">contact form</a> and I'll probably respond.</p>
        <p>Thanks for checking me out and God bless!</p>

        <p class="mt-4">Thanks! <br> -Google Hat Guy.</p>
